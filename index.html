        <h1>Privacy Policy for Fooseroo</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy describes how your personal data is collected and processed in connection with the Android app "Fooseroo". Since the protection of your data is important to us, we would like to inform you transparently about our practices.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>The data controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is:</p>
        <p>Sven Nickel<br>
        Nedlitzer Str. 7<br>
        14612 Falkensee<br>
        Germany<br>
        Email: <a href="mailto:sven.nickel+fooseroo@gmail.com">sven.nickel+fooseroo@gmail.com</a><br>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Types of Data Processed</h2>
        <p>Fooseroo is a free Android app. While the app itself does not require a user account and does not collect sensitive personal data, it offers an optional in-app purchase to support the developer with a ""coffee"" donation.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Donation Data:</strong></p>
        <p>If you choose to make a donation, your payment will be processed through a third-party payment service provider. The following data may be collected by the payment service provider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Payment card details</li>
                <li>Billing address</li>
                <li>Transaction ID</li>
                <li>Date and time of the transaction</li>
                <li>Amount of the donation</li>
            </ul>
        <p>We, as the app developer, will only receive anonymized information about the success of the donation.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Anonymized Usage Statistics:</strong></p>
        <p>In order to improve the app and better adapt it to the needs of the users, we use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized usage statistics. These statistics include, for example, information about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>App crashes</li>
                <li>App start times</li>
                <li>Functions used</li>
                <li>Interactions within the app</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The collection of this data is optional for the user. You can choose in the app settings whether this data collection should take place or not. If you deactivate the collection, no usage statistics will be collected.</p>

        <h2>3. Legal Basis of Processing</h2>
        <p>The processing of your data is based on the following legal bases:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Donation Data:</strong> The processing of payment data for donations is necessary for the performance of a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) with the payment service provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymized Usage Statistics:</strong> The processing of your anonymized usage data is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You have the right to revoke your consent at any time by deactivating the data collection in the app settings. The revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out on the basis of consent until revocation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Disclosure of Data to Third Parties</h2>
        <p>The anonymized data collected as part of Firebase Analytics is transmitted to Google. Google may use this data to provide and improve its services. For more information on data processing by Google, please see Google's privacy policy:</p>
        <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>
        <p><strong>Payment Service Provider:</strong> Your payment data will be transmitted to the third-party payment service provider for the purpose of processing the donation. We have carefully selected this provider and ensured that it complies with the applicable data protection regulations.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, your data will not be disclosed, sold or otherwise disclosed to third parties, unless this is required by law.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss or misuse. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption, firewalls, and secure data storage. We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet can involve security risks.</p>

        <h2>6. International Data Transfer</h2>
        <p>The data collected by Firebase Analytics may be transferred to Google servers in the USA and other countries outside the European Union. Google is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. More information about that you can find here: <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EU-US Data Privacy Framework</a></p>
        <p><strong>Payment Data:</strong> Your payment data may also be transferred to and processed in countries outside the European Union by the payment service provider. We have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data, such as standard contractual clauses or certification under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights as a User</h2>
        <p>As a user, you have the following rights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to obtain information about the data we process. Since we only process anonymized data, it is generally not possible for us to assign this data to a specific person.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to request the correction of incorrect data. Since we only process anonymized data, a correction is generally not possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of your data.  For donation data, you can request deletion from the payment service provider. Since you can deactivate the collection of anonymized usage data in the app settings, this is equivalent to deletion.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your data. Since we only process anonymized data and you can deactivate the collection, a restriction is generally not necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to object to the processing of your data. You can object to the processing of your data by deactivating the data collection in the app settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your data violates the GDPR.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy to adapt it to changed legal requirements or technical circumstances. The updated privacy policy will be published in the app and on our website. It is recommended that you review this privacy policy regularly.</p>
